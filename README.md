### hey ya! 
I go by a lot of names, but you can call me Flush. I have been Programming for about 6 years on and off. 
My most recent project I worked on was my discordbot called "Charterbot". The library I used is no longer being worked on :(.

I have been working on a Django site using Django 4.1 and Python 3.10. I am looking fwd to creating a Newspaper template using the skills I gained doing this :).

I am mostly into 2d/3d animation, and gamedev. So I mainly work on blender addons, and Godot stuff. 

I have stopped using Github has much since MicroSoft bought it, and I try to not think about it lol. 

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on: A games using the Heaps.io framework.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning: How to create games in Godot and Heaps.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on: Django/python projects
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with: Django

- ðŸ“« How to reach me: Flush#1412 on discord or ryedev on Keybase
- âš¡ Fun fact: I coded my own Linux distro at 15.
