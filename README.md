### hey ya! 
I go by a lot of names, but you can call me Flush. I have been Programming for about 6 years on and off. 
My most recent project I worked on was my discordbot called "Charterbot". The library I used is no long being worked on :(.

I am mostly into 2d/3d animation, and gamedev. So I mainly work on blender addons, and Godot stuff. 

I have stopped using Github has much since MicroSoft bought it, and I try to not think about it lol.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning: How to create games in Godot and Heaps.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on: Adding more support for cameras in Tahoma2D for StopMotion.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with Adding SDKs to Tahoma2D for more camera support.
