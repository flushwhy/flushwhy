### hey ya! 
I go by a lot of names, but you can call me Flush. I have been Programming for about 11 years on and off. 
I have been working on creating games in both Godot and Unreal, with hopes of creating my own game engine soon.

I have stopped using Github has much since MicroSoft bought it, and I try to not think about it lol.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning: How to create games in Godot and Unreal.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on: Python/C++ projects around game dev or Animation.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with: Life
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about: Python, C++, Game Dev, Blender, or anything I have projects on.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: _flush on discord.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I love the old Jaks games.
